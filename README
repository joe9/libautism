emalloc and not emallocz
<BurnZeZ> The first problem I see is emallocz  [14:48]
<BurnZeZ> emallocz is sort of pointless  [14:50]
<BurnZeZ> The reason is that emalloc() is well known to set the allocated memory to 0s
<joe9> Thanks for looking at it.
<BurnZeZ> It would probably be okay to call mallocz() inside it, though
<joe9> emalloc is using memset anyway.
<joe9> ok, I will rename it back to emalloc.  [14:51]
<joe9> makes sense.
<BurnZeZ> I can’t remember why I used memset instead of mallocz
<BurnZeZ> It might have just been to avoid pulling in mallocz() unnecessarily in the
          resulting binary  [14:52]
<BurnZeZ> So literally autism

extern usage
<joe9> another thing I noticed is that all the functions are defined using
       extern. With the system libraries, I do not see extern being used.
<BurnZeZ> It might get pulled in by random stuff anyway
<BurnZeZ> Hmm
<BurnZeZ> Ah, yeah  [14:53]
<BurnZeZ> That’s actually a feature
<BurnZeZ> It’s so the function definitions can be replaced with something in your own
          code
<BurnZeZ> For example, maybe you want to debug some specific call, so you just
          re-define the function in your code  [14:54]
<BurnZeZ> Then insert error checking/handling
<joe9> cool, Thanks.  [14:55]
<BurnZeZ> Some stuff does do the extern thing though
